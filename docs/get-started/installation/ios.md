The mobile app will provide the same core functionality as the desktop agents. The app will be implemented as a VPN service that supports split tunneling. This means you can run the VPN continuously in the background while your regular network traffic remains unaffected, and you'll be simultaneously connected to the drasyl network.

1. **Internal Testing** (current) - Closed beta for selected testers
