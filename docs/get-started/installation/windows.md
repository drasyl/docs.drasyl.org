# Installing drasyl on Windows

This guide explains how to install and run drasyl on Windows, including the background service (daemon) and the system tray UI.

## Step-by-Step Installation

We provide a Windows installer that sets up both the daemon and UI automatically.

### Step 1: Download the Installer

* Click the following link to download the installer: ðŸ“¦ [drasyl_0.1.0_windows.exe](https://download.drasyl.org/binaries/0.1.0/windows-amd64/drasyl_0.1.0_windows.exe)
* The download should start automatically.

:::info Windows Security Warning
You might get warned by Microsoft Defender SmartScreen that it couldn't verify if the file is safe. Click **"Show more"** and then **"Keep anyway"**.
:::

### Step 2: Run the Installer

* Open the file directly from your browser, or locate it in your Downloads folder and double-click the installer.
* User Account Control might ask to allow the app to make changes to your device. Click **"Yes"**.
* Follow the installation wizard to complete the installation.
* After installation, the drasyl daemon runs automatically as a Windows service.

### Step 3: Start the drasyl UI

* Open the Start menu, search for **"drasyl UI"**, and click to launch it.
* The drasyl UI runs in the system tray (bottom-right corner). If itâ€™s not immediately visible, click the arrow to show hidden icons.

:::info First Startup Delay
On first startup, the UI may take a few seconds to connect to the daemon, as the daemon completes the proof-of-work process to generate your device identity.
:::

Once started, the drasyl UI will display the public key of your local device.

      width: '100%',
      borderRadius: '8px',
      boxShadow: '0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)',
      margin: '1rem auto'
    }}
  />

:::tip Copy Public Key
You can copy your public key by clicking on it in the drasyl UI.
Alternatively, run `"C:\Program Files\drasyl\drasyl.exe" status --token "C:\ProgramData\drasyl\auth.token"` in your command prompt to display it.
